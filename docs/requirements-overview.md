# S.C.O.U.T. v3 Requirements Overview

This document synthesizes the provided strategic blueprint, frontend specification, and backend API architecture into an actionable phased backlog.

## 1. Vision Summary
S.C.O.U.T. v3 is an autonomous AI-driven hiring intelligence platform providing:
- Autonomous orchestration of hiring workflows (up to 95% automation)
- Multimodal behavioral + predictive talent evaluation
- Cultural DNA matching & long-horizon performance forecasting
- Real-time adaptive assessment and AI avatar interviewing
- Rich analytics, explainability, and compliance

## 2. High-Level Architecture
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Zustand, React Query, Tailwind, WebRTC, Socket.IO, WebSocket AI channels
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11), PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Celery, AI model services, WebSockets
- Infrastructure: Azure (AKS, Blob Storage, Service Bus, PostgreSQL Flexible Server), Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, Whisper, DALL·E, Azure Cognitive, custom behavioral & predictive models

## 3. Functional Domains
1. Candidate Experience (Landing, Verification, Welcome, Assessments, Interview, Completion, Feedback)
2. Assessment Engine (Session mgmt, Multimodal capture, Adaptive flow, Coding sandbox / Simulation)
3. AI Interview & Multimodal Analysis (Avatar interaction, Voice/facial/behavioral analysis)
4. Predictive Modeling (Success, retention, cultural fit, trajectory)
5. Admin Operations (Login, Dashboard, Candidate CRUD, Invitations, Templates, Settings)
6. Analytics & Reporting (Assessment analytics, candidate reports, KPIs dashboard)
7. Real-Time Monitoring (Live assessment console)
8. Security & Compliance (AuthN/Z, MFA, rate limiting, audit trail, explainability, bias mitigation)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Performance | <3s initial load, real-time updates <300ms latency target |
| Scalability | Horizontal scale via AKS; stateless services; async tasks |
| Reliability | 99.9% service uptime target; multi-region backups |
| Security | Zero-trust, MFA, encryption in transit + at rest, audit logs |
| Compliance | GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 readiness, explainable AI decisions |
| Observability | Structured logging, metrics, tracing (OpenTelemetry) |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA for all UI |
| Privacy | Candidate data ownership, revocation, minimization |

## 5. Data Model (Initial MVP Subset)
Core Entities (MVP): Candidate, Assessment, AssessmentResponse, MultimodalAnalysis, PredictiveScore.
Later: AssessmentTemplate, BehavioralSession, ReportCache, WebhookEvent.

## 6. Incremental Delivery Roadmap
### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Repo scaffolding (DONE)
- Backend skeleton: FastAPI app, health endpoint, settings, logging
- Frontend skeleton: Vite React TS, Tailwind config, basic routing
- Docker dev containers for frontend/backend
- .gitignore, pre-commit hooks (lint, format)
- Requirements & package manifests

### Phase 1: Auth & Candidate Onboarding (Weeks 3-4)
- Candidate verification endpoint + token creation
- Admin login (JWT + refresh) + MFA stub
- Frontend pages: Landing, Verify, Welcome
- DB schema migrations (candidates, assessments)
- Basic email service abstraction

### Phase 2: Assessment Session Core (Weeks 5-6)
- Start assessment endpoint & session state
- WebSocket channel for assessment interactions
- Question delivery + response persistence (text)
- Frontend assessment pages (vision, skills stub)

### Phase 3: Multimodal & Interview Foundations (Weeks 7-8)
- WebRTC capture pipeline skeleton
- Multimodal analysis endpoint stub (async task placeholder)
- AI avatar interaction mock (scripted responses)

### Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting (Weeks 9-10)
- Candidate report endpoint (simple aggregated scores)
- Admin dashboard metrics (counts, completion rates)

### Phase 5: Predictive & Cultural Intelligence (Weeks 11-13)
- Predictive scores service (mock models -> real integration)
- Cultural fit feature engineering pipeline

### Phase 6: Optimization & Compliance (Weeks 14-16)
- Rate limiting, audit logging, bias detection hooks
- Observability stack instrumentation

(Iterations beyond expand AI depth, model accuracy, adaptive flows.)

## 7. MVP Definition (Release Gate)
MVP is achieved when:
- Candidates can receive an invitation, verify, complete a multi-section assessment (text-based), and receive a basic feedback summary.
- Admins can invite candidates, monitor assessment status, and view simple analytics.
- Basic AI-generated explanation placeholders exist (even if rule-based early).

## 8. Backlog (Epic → High-Level Stories)
EPIC: Backend Foundation
- Story: As a system I expose /health and version metadata.
- Story: As a developer I use structured logging & centralized settings.

EPIC: Candidate Auth & Onboarding
- Story: Candidate verifies token to start assessment (security & expiry).
- Story: System creates initial assessment record upon verification.

EPIC: Assessment Engine
- Story: Start session -> deliver first section questions.
- Story: Store response & compute provisional score.

EPIC: Multimodal Pipeline
- Story: Attach multimodal capture flags to a question payload.
- Story: Queue analysis job (async) and return correlation insights.

EPIC: Predictive Modeling
- Story: Generate predictive success placeholder after assessment completion.

EPIC: Admin Portal
- Story: Admin login with JWT & role claims.
- Story: Admin invites candidate via email & config template.

EPIC: Analytics & Reporting
- Story: Admin views counts, avg completion time, and conversion funnel.
- Story: Candidate can download feedback summary.

## 9. Technical Baselines
- Config: 12-factor; environment-driven.
- Logging: JSON structured; correlation IDs.
- API Versioning: /api/v3 prefix.
- Error Format: Unified envelope {"error": {...}}.
- Task Queue: Celery (future), stub early for interface.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Early over-engineering | Phase gating & MVP discipline |
| Latency from heavy AI calls | Async tasks + streaming partial insights |
| Bias/legal compliance | Embedded audit & fairness metrics early |
| Model drift | Scheduled evaluation & feedback loop |
| Data privacy | Strict scoping & anonymization for training |

## 11. Immediate Action Items (Next PR)
1. Add backend skeleton (health, settings).
2. Add frontend skeleton (landing placeholder).
3. Add tooling (.gitignore, Prettier, Ruff/Black, ESLint, Tailwind).
4. Add Dockerfiles for local orchestration.
5. Add basic Makefile / task runner.
